Below is a description of Data Analysis, Statistics and Probabilities:
Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability are mathematical 
processes that help solve real-world problems. Probability helps predict the likelihood that an event will happen. 
To help predict the probability of events, people use statistical information and data.

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that helps you make sense of data.

Some of the most important statistical calculations include computing the sample size and population; the mean, mode, and median; standard deviation; and variance.

Read graphs and charts and determine the probability of simple and compound events.
You might also be asked to find the mean, median, mode and range of a data set.

The mean is the average of all the given numbers. To compute for the mean, you need to add all the values and divide the sum by the number of all the given values.

The median is the middle value in an odd number of ordered values of a data set or the average between the two middle values in an even number of ordered values in a data set.

The mode is the value that is repeated most often in a given set of values.

The range is the difference between the highest and lowest numbers within the given set of values.

The simplest formula for finding the probability is to divide the number of ways an event can happen by the number of possible outcomes.
